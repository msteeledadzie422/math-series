### Setup:

VENV Creation: python3 -m venv .venv
VENV Activation: source .venv/bin/activate

Initialize App: python3 -m series

### Tests:

This application contains tests for each series function. 

Tests are written to ensure each function is able to instantiate, and that each function can produce correct values for 1 and 5.

There are further tests to confirm that the sum_series function is able to correctly create the Lucas series, and that it can correctly create a new series with unique starting points.
